Although I didn't know it yet, this journey began almost 10 years ago in Boston, with Susana Muñoz. A study about the Ivory Coast, a presentation at M.I.T. and a strong determination to continue learning. New plans and a new future. Then Oscar Corcho appears, and thanks to him everything starts to take shape. I discover science in the Ontology Engineering Group, with great colleagues who are also great researchers. Asunción Gómez, Jorge Gracia, Victor Fernandez, Raul Garcia, Elena Montiel, Mariano Fernandez, Jose Angel Ramos and Mariano Rico. I am especially impressed by the talks with María Poveda, Dani Vila and Julia Bosque. I thank you for your patience with me, I have learned a lot from you, I admire you. Research means reading, understanding, testing and also collaborating. I am very grateful for the interactions with Daniel Garijo, Filip Radulovic and Idafen Santana, with Rafael Gonzalez, with Nandana and Freddy Priyatna, with Pablo Calleja, with Esteban Gonzalez and with Fernando Serena, because all of them have shaped this work. And I cannot forget the DiversiTeam, the team with the best players, even those who do not play, because there are no barriers for us. I don't want to forget anyone, you are all part of this: David Chaves, Paola Espinoza, Francisco Yedro, Alba Fernandez, Maria Navas, Patricia Martin, Elvira Amador, Edna Ruckhaus, Alvaro Brandon, Serge, Andres, Ana, Julian...and those who will soon join: Ahmad, Andrea, Vicky, Raul Alcazar or Miguel Angel.


My supervisors, Oscar Corcho and Jose Luis Redondo, deserve a special mention. You have the ability to choose the right words and make it easy. You have complemented each other perfectly, even from the distance, and I have enjoyed every year of this thesis. Oscar knows how to touch the right keys at the right time, and Jose Luis have simplified any problem, no matter how complex it was. I am extremely lucky to have you by my side on this journey, and you have influenced my route for the future.


Not everyone I love is here, but I know they will be proud of me. Not for the thesis, but for the decisions that led me to it. Federico and Loli, I see you smiling now and that makes me happy. I am what I am thanks to you. And it is also partly because of you, Ana and Lucia.

Thank you so much Beatriz for being my other half. These have been very intense years, with many changes and challenges, but we have been able to keep smiling and move forward. I hope Martin and Alonso also feel proud of us, we don't know how to be any other way. I will miss the nights at work when we would look at each other and listen to them cry.
