% huge data (https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7612-457a)
% large-scale
% Around 8 TB of textual data are consumed everyday by electronic media. 
% https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-05/ra_pan_2019_interieur_en_final.pdf
Huge amounts of textual documents are produced daily in digital format. Every second, more than two thousand blog entries are published, nine thousand tweets are written, and more than two million emails are sent on the internet\footnote{https://www.internetlivestats.com/one-second}. The number of scientific publications per year has increased by 8-9\%~ in the last decade \citep{Ware2018STM}. More than one million papers, about two per minute,  were submitted to the PubMed database, the leading database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical research, during last year. Statistics on judicial activity are similar. More than 168,000 procedural documents and 3,000 judicial notices were published in the Official Journal of the European Union in 2019 \footnote{\url{https://curia.europa.eu}}. Unlike the academic domain where articles are mostly published in English, legal documents are usually available in multiple languages. The Court of Justice of the European Union had to translate over 1 million texts into its 24 official languages, with 552 possible language combinations, in just one year. These numbers make it virtually impossible for an expert in an academic or legal domain to stay abreast by only reading a few articles nowadays. Navigating the growing torrent of textual data and exploring their content is not only necessary, but has become a crucial job that experts must add to their daily tasks. 

Document retrieval techniques are being used nowadays to facilitate text review in such big collections. Major digital publishers specialized in scientific\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com}}, technical\footnote{\url{https://www.elsevier.com}}, and medical\footnote{\url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}} content provide search engines to make it easier to browse their collections of scientific articles. Given a few keywords, a list of relevant papers is retrieved and offered for reading. Legal documents are also exploited through similar solutions. The Spanish\footnote{\url{https://www.oepm.es}}, American\footnote{\url{https://www.uspto.gov/}} and European\footnote{\url{https://www.epo.org}} intellectual property registration offices, for example, allow exploring their patent collections by search engines guided by keywords and/or categories. These categories are available because documents are manually categorized by their authors according to the International Patent Classification (IPC) system. It contains approximately 70,000 different codes for different technical areas. This label-based browsing\footnote{\url{https://patents.google.com}} has been also adopted by several academic search engines\footnote{\url{https://academic.microsoft.com}} to organize papers by research areas, or even by evaluation tasks to browse state-of-the-art methods\footnote{\url{https://paperswithcode.com}}. In the natural language processing domain, research papers are organized into 256 tasks such as 'knowledge representation', 'question-answering', 'machine translation' and so on. However, while there are initiatives to normalize research areas, the use of keywords by authors in the form of tags to categorize their scientific papers is still insufficient and some text processing tasks are required to set labels to articles following a uniform criteria. One of the main reasons that limits its widespread use is the difficulty that authors have in picking labels that describe their research work in sufficient detail.

% A new research field or category appear?
But what happens when a new research field or a new category emerges?. Searches guided by keywords or tags are useful when the domain is known, but when new categories appear these mechanisms may be insufficient. Researchers use reviewing to keep abreast of new discoveries. It helps to spark new ideas and approaches for their projects. But the problem is not all researchers are asked to peer review and those who are might struggle to fit it into their busy schedules, especially when the article is outside their area of expertise. Exist academic reports that identify the hottest and emerging specialty areas in scientific research from the last years\footnote{\url{https://discover.clarivate.com/ResearchFronts2019_EN}}. The methodology used in these reports assumes that cumulatively, and over time, citations in research leave a trail that highlights progress and advancements across a range of fields. By regularly tracking these citations and unpacking the patterns and groupings of how papers are cited, in particular clusters of papers that are frequently cited together, new research areas take shape. After an in-depth analysis, reports describe the research lines covered by these groups of research articles. Such reports also exist on patent collections to discover technology trends\footnote{\url{https://www.wipo.int/tech_trends}}.

Therefore, identifying relationships between documents is key to facilitating their exploration. A documentary exploration does not stop when a relevant article is found, but starts from its content shaping the area of interest through its relations. Most academic\footnote{\url{https://www.semanticscholar.org}} and legal\footnote{\url{https://patents.google.com}} search engines provide a list of related documents for each text and offer navigating through them. The relationship between two documents can be based on references, when documents are cited by others\footnote{\url{http://citationgecko.com}}, or content, when documents share a thematic area, etc. The chains of articles derived from that related content can lead to more complex structures when cross-relations are considered. A document can be related to another that, in turn, is related to a third one that can be also related to the first article. This content-guided exploration helps to browse document collections by areas of interest not necessarily aligned with a list of predefined categories. A visual overview of an academic field, for example, can be provided by showing graphs of articles with similar content\footnote{\url{https://www.connectedpapers.com}}.

While these initiatives are valuable efforts to address access to huge amounts of documents, they are still insufficient to make the most out of the knowledge available within the textual collection. On an individual level, the knowledge derived from a text comes from the concepts evoked by its words \citep{Griffiths2007}. On a collective level, the knowledge derived from a document collection emerges from the relationships among its texts \citep{Kenter2015}. Two modes of knowledge inferences are needed, a \textit{bottom-up} from documents to collection-aware units, and a \textit{top-bottom} from document relationships to specific info in texts. A semantic awareness is desirable to interpret the relationships and guide the exploration. The focus is on why some texts are related and what concepts are key to those relationships. But analyzing and comparing texts on a large scale requires addressing some challenges imposed by external conditions that have appeared in recent years:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complexity}: The increasing variety of topics, subjects, in those ever growing collections, has forced a reconsideration of the way to compare them. The operations required to compute each comparison should be simplified as much as possible.
\item \textbf{Efficiency}: The algorithms, besides being accurate enough, must be also efficient in order to be applied on a large scale. Brute-force techniques cannot be applied to compare all items in a huge corpus.
\item \textbf{Explainability}: The associations between documents must be explained in such a way that the relationship itself provides knowledge about the content of the texts. It is not enough that one text is related to another, it is necessary to explain why it is so. 
\item \textbf{Multilinguality}: In addition, the increasing availability of texts written in different natural languages also makes it necessary to address comparison in multilingual collections. In these collections, external translation systems cannot been considered as the only applicable solution, since they increase processing costs and potentially introduce a bias in the relationships that are obtained. 
\end{itemize}

In our work we aim at facilitating the exploration of huge collections of documents written in multiple languages. We address the problem of comparing them on a large scale while enabling a semantic-aware exploration through their content. Our proposal automatically discovers thematic associations between texts using probabilistic topic models and organizes document collections so that they can be efficiently and transparently browsed through the related content regardless of their language.

\section{Contributions}

The following contributions are presented in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scalable Framework for Topic Modeling}: We introduce a text processing model that supports the creation of probabilistic topic models. Based on this abstraction, we implement a framework that becomes the foundation of this thesis research, which is used as a tool for supporting performance analysis and algorithm design.
\item \textbf{Lifecycle Management of Topic Models}: To facilitate the exploitation of trained topic models, we propose a unified form to publish and (re)use models based on Web services available from online repositories.
\item \textbf{Hierarchical Thematic Annotations}: To study the problem of representativeness in high dimensional topic models, we exploit the relationships between texts derived from their topic distributions. We show how the distances vary between the same texts when the dimensions of the model change, and how less representative topics can influence their calculation. Our analytical and experimental results show that as more topics are available in the model, less representative are the distance measurements based on densities. During the study, we identified hierarchies in the topic distributions that maintain their representativeness regardless of the dimensions of the model, and without losing the ability to measure distances. We propose a method to annotate texts using topic hierarchies, and a distance metric based on this hierarchical representations.
\item \textbf{Support for Large-scale Document Similarity Comparisons}: We present an efficient mechanism to index and retrieve related documents, described by hierarchical annotations, while allowing the exploration of the collection by the themes inferred from its texts.
\item \textbf{Discovery of Cross-lingual Document Relations}: We introduce a technique to transform probabilistic topics from different languages into a single representation space based on shared concepts where texts can be thematically related regardless of the language used.
\end{itemize}
