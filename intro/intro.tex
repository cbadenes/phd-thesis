Huge amounts of textual documents are produced daily in digital format. Every second more than two thousand blog entries are published, nine thousand tweets are written, and more than two million emails are sent in the Internet\footnote{https://www.internetlivestats.com/one-second}. The number of scientific publications per year has increased by 8-9\%~ in the last decade \citep{Ware2018STM}. More than one million papers, about two per minute,  were submitted to the PubMed database, the leading database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical research, in the last year. Statistics on judicial activity are similar. More than 168,000 procedural documents and 3,000 judicial notices were published in the Official Journal of the European Union in 2019 \footnote{\url{https://curia.europa.eu}}. Unlike the academic domain where articles are mostly published in English, legal documents are usually available in multiple languages. The Court of Justice of the European Union had to translate over 1 million texts into its 24 official languages, with 552 possible language combinations, in just one year. These numbers make it virtually impossible for an expert in an academic or legal domain to stay abreast by only reading a few articles nowadays. Navigating the growing torrent of textual data and exploring their content is not only necessary, but has become a second job that experts must add to their daily tasks. 

Document retrieval techniques are being used nowadays to facilitate text review in such big collections. Major digital publishers specialized in scientific\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com}}, technical\footnote{\url{https://www.elsevier.com}}, and medical\footnote{\url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}} content provide search engines to make it easier to browse their collections of scientific articles. Given a few keywords, a list of relevant papers is retrieved and offered for reading. Legal documents are also exploited with similar solutions. The Spanish\footnote{\url{https://www.oepm.es}}, American\footnote{\url{https://www.uspto.gov/}} and European\footnote{\url{https://www.epo.org}} patent and intellectual property registration offices, for example, allow exploring their patent collections by search engines guided by keywords and/or categories. These categories are available because documents are manually categorized by their authors according to the International Patent Classification (IPC) system. It contains approximately 70,000 different codes for different technical areas. This label-based browsing\footnote{\url{https://patents.google.com}} has been also adopted by several academic search engines\footnote{\url{https://academic.microsoft.com}} to organize papers by research areas, or even by evaluation tasks to browse state-of-the-art methods\footnote{\url{https://paperswithcode.com}}. In the natural language processing domain, for example, research papers are organized into 256 tasks such as 'knowledge representation', 'question-answering', 'machine translation' and so on. However, while there are initiatives to normalize research areas, the use of keywords by authors in the form of tags to categorize their scientific papers is still insufficient and some text processing tasks are necessary to set labels to articles following a uniform criteria. One of the main reasons that limits its widespread use is the difficulty that authors have in picking labels that describe their research work in sufficient detail.

Along with searches based on keywords and categories, the third key aspect aimed at facilitating the exploration of documentary corpora is the provision of related texts. A documentary exploration does not stop when a relevant article is found, but starts from its content shaping the area of interest. Most academic\footnote{\url{https://www.semanticscholar.org}} and legal\footnote{\url{https://patents.google.com}} search engines provide a list of related documents for each text and offer navigating through them. The relationship can be based on references, when documents are cited by others, or content, when documents share a thematic area. The chains of articles derived from that related content can lead to more complex structures when cross-relations are considered. A document can be related to another that, in turn, is related to a third one that can be also related to the first article. This content-guided exploration helps to browse document collections by areas of interest not necessarily aligned with a list of predefined categories. A visual overview of an academic field, for example, can be provided by showing graphs of articles with similar content\footnote{\url{https://www.connectedpapers.com}}.


While these initiatives are valuable efforts to address access to huge amounts of documents, they are still insufficient to examine the content offered by their texts. On an individual level, the knowledge derived from a text comes from the concepts evoked by its words \citep{Griffiths2007}. On a collective level, the knowledge derived from a document collection emerges from the relationships among its texts \citep{Kenter2015}. Exploring a textual corpus and therefore acquiring some knowledge of its texts requires understanding how its documents are organized through the concepts evoked by its words. It is necessary to focus on why some texts are related to others, and what concepts are key to those relationships. But analyzing and comparing texts on a large scale requires addressing some challenges imposed by external conditions that have appeared in recent years:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complexity}: The huge number of documents has forced a reconsideration of the way to compare them in order to be able to deal with big collections. The time required to compute each comparison should be reduced as much as possible.
\item \textbf{Efficiency}: The algorithms, besides being accurate enough, must be also efficient in order to be applied on a large scale. Brute-force techniques cannot be applied to compare all items in a huge corpus.
\item \textbf{Explainability}: The associations between documents must be explained in such a way that the relationship itself provides knowledge about the content of the texts. It is not enough that one text is related to another, it is necessary to explain why it is so. 
\item \textbf{Multilinguality}: In addition, the increasing availability of texts written in different natural languages also makes it necessary to address comparison in multilingual collections. In these collections, external translation systems cannot been considered as the only applicable solution, since they increase processing costs and potentially introduce a bias in the relationships that are obtained. 
\end{itemize}

In our work we aim at facilitating the exploration of huge collections of documents written in multiple languages. We address the problem of comparing them on a large scale while enabling a semantic-aware exploration through their content. Our proposal automatically discovers thematic associations between texts using probabilistic topic models and organizes document collections so that they can be efficiently and transparently browsed through the related content regardless of their language.

\section{Contributions}

% introducir antes las contribuciones, un poco de bla bla
The following contributions are presented in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Large-scale Topic-creation Framework}: We introduce a text processing model that supports the creation of probabilistic topic models. Based on this model, we implement a framework that becomes the foundation of this thesis research, which is used as a tool for supporting performance analysis and algorithm design.
\item \textbf{Topic Model Publication and Exploitation}: To facilitate the reuse and exploitation of trained topic models, we propose a format to publish models as web services and provide an online repository with models available for use.
\item \textbf{Hierarchical Thematic Annotations}: To study the problem of representativeness in high dimensional topic models, we exploit the relationships between texts derived from their topic distributions. We show how the distances vary between the same texts when the dimensions of the model change, and how less representative topics can influence their calculation. Our analytical and experimental results show that as more topics are available in the model, less representative are the distance measurements based on densities. During the study, we identified hierarchies in the topic distributions that maintain their representativeness regardless of the dimensions of the model, and without losing the ability to measure distances. We propose a method to annotate texts using topic hierarchies, and a distance metric based on this hierarchical representations.
\item \textbf{Support for Massive Document Similarity Comparisons}: We present an efficient mechanism to index and retrieve related documents, described by multi-level annotations , while allowing the exploration of the collection by the themes inferred from its texts.
\item \textbf{Discovery of Cross-lingual Document Relations}: We introduce a technique to transform probabilistic topics from different languages into a single representation space based on shared concepts where texts can be thematically related regardless of the language used.
\end{itemize}
